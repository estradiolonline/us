A much weaker form of estrogen is called estradiol dipropionate.

As an estrogen, estradiol is almost exclusively (98% or more) produced in the ovaries.

In men, estradiol levels are low, often due to the small amounts produced in the testicles.

However, in other parts of the body, estradiol levels are much higher than estradiol.

The estradiol in men is more likely to be due to the liver and fat body than the ovaries, though it is still formed in the ovaries.

Men, like women, have higher levels of estradiol than women.

Estradiol levels in the blood can be measured by a blood test.
